- Removed custom animation script because when NPC's run into each other, they clog each other's animations. Roblox's legacy script allows the NPC's to smoothly animate, even when cogged

## 1.0.8
#### Additions
- Added in TargetLineOFSightDist in settings & removed AttackDist.

- Instead of two same functions for two different events, I combined the two functions for less lines of code.
- If the remote function did not return in the Stats UI, the stats text would be displayed as "N/A."
#### Removals
- Removed the round function from the helper module as it was only used in one script. Readded it to the NPC handler. Therefore making that module a function for a new thread..
- Removed some useless code in some scripts as well as reorganized.

#### Additions
- Added an optional distance argument to the check sight function.  Added a line of sight distance setting. Changed detection distance and attack delay settings.

#### Changes
- Disconnected events that were no longer in use so they won't cause performance issues and clug up the memory.
- Combined the new thread and round function into a module.
- Changed the touched event for the attack listener to the hands instead of just the root.
#### Fixes
- Fixed the non-humanoid defeat music to not immediately stop after playing.
#### Removals

## 1.0.6
#### Additions
- Added in a defeat sound if the non-humanoid target is destroyed.
- Made NPC move directly to the target if it is in its direct line of sight. 
#### Changes
- Changed update delay to 0.5 sec. 

## 0.1.0
#### Additions
- Added in points near the non-humanoid target. NPC's wil now run to a point with the least amount of NPC's at it instead of running to the non-humanoid target. This allows less grouping, but the grouping issue has not been fully resolved yet.
